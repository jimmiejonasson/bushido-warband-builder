      <h1>About Bushido Risen Sun</h1>
      <p>
        In Bushido - Risen Sun, sword and fist clash against magic and monster,
        black powder weapons spew shot and smoke, samurai stride into battle
        against great monsters, and ninja strike from the shadows while the dead
        rise at the command of shadowy cultists. The Jwar Isles have found
        themselves out of balance and all factions are looking to help return
        their home to the proper order or to take advantage!

      <h2>Warband Composition</h2>
      <p>
        To recruit a Warband, players must choose a Rice Limit and a Faction to
        play. The Rice Limit determines the size of the game, you can play any
        amount of Rice for a game we suggest the following: The Faction Starter
        boxes has models totalling 70 Rice The Faction Starter boxes also has
        has a 3 model, 40 Rice list. The 2 player box has 40 Rice for each
        Faction. Tournament games are 100 Rice. A warband may not be of the
        Ronin Faction. A player’s Warband in Bushido is made up of a number of
        models and any Special cards from the same Faction or Ronin that work
        for that Faction. The Rice Cost of your Warband must come to the total
        agreed upon with your Opponent. Players can only recruit one of each
        card; this does not prohibit the Opponent from recruiting the card for
        their Warband. Sometimes two or more models are represented by the same
        profile card. A player can choose to recruit as many models as there are
        Wound tracks on the profile card. Ronin Models Ronin represent
        wanderers, mercenaries, diplomats, outcasts and other individuals who
        may fight for more than one Faction. From the Prefecture hiring the
        services of Bikou to three Imperial Princesses expecting the hospitality
        of the Tengu or Sojobo, leaving his people without a King to seek the
        enlightenment of the Temple, Ronin each have different motivations for
        working with many Factions but all follow these rules. Ronin models can
        be included in warbands of multiple different factions, Ronin models may
        be recruited into any warband of a faction that is listed on the Ronin
        card either by faction symbol or in words. Ronin are NOT considered to
        be of the faction of the warband they are recruited into for game
        effects. If an effect specifies it works only on Faction models then it
        does not work on ronin. Ronin can only have Ronin Enhancement cards and
        cannot be included in any Faction theme lists unless the theme specifies
        Ronin of that type. They can be included in Ronin Theme Lists. It is
        permissible to make a list for a given faction that includes only Ronin
        models that work for that Faction but when creating a warband you cannot
        choose Ronin as your Faction. Example: A Prefecture list using the Blood
        of the Dragon theme can include Samurai but cannot include Golden
        Sentinel models as the theme does not include Ronin Samurai. Example: It
        is possible to create a Warband entirely made of Ronin. First choose a
        faction (Prefecture, Ito, Silvermoon etc…) and choose Ronin available to
        that faction. It is not a “Ronin Faction” list as this is not permitted.
